## Design
----

The site's owner wanted a modern 2022-style website. They decided on a five-color scheme incorporating a pastel tone colour pallet from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/), we checked the colour pallet using [EigthShapes Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23faf8f6%2C%0D%0A%2300a4fcd9%0D%0A%234244b9%0D%0A%23191641%0D%0A%23536075de&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp), I decided to go with a simple design as they had chosen a five colour palette scheme of an off-white, a shade of gray (used only on styling the navbar) these were used in contrast with a light blue for the hover state of the buttons. The dark blue colour and off-white combination for the button's statics state this gives the buttons the highest rating in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) for text/background.

## Features

### Existing Features



* Navigation Menu 
    - This features on all pages of this website. The style is consistent across all pages to allow the user to intuitively navigate each section of the main landing page, and its content as well as intuitively navigate to other pages like the contact form.  The navigation menu has been styled with html and css only, on large screens the nav will display the page links and the logo inline at the top of the page and on small devices the nav will change in to a hambeurger drop down menu that is still usable, when hoverd over the links will change colour with a indicator line letting you know that the button is actionable.

![Closed Navigation Menu Mobile](assets/images/NAV-MOBILE-CLOSED.webp)

![Open Navigation Menu Mobile](assets/images/NAV-MOBILE-OPEN.webp)

* Footer 
    - Social network Links to Facebook, Instagram and twitter, that have a active transitions in color that allows the user to know the links are active, so they can stay connected to the companys activities and see regular posts.
    - Telephone number and email address in footer on every page. This means that the user does not have to navigate to a different page to have access to this information if they decide they want to email or telephone. 

![Footer](assets/images/RESPONSIVE-FOOTER-A.webp)
![Footer](assets/images/RESPONSIVE-FOOTER-B.webp)   
  

* Home Page Features
    - The hero-image that is on the main landing page seems to be very eye catching with the contrast between the bright colours natural tones it becomes very striking. the about section leaves out enough information to entice the site user to make an enquiry.
    - There is also a contact button within the navbar which links directly to the contact form page.  This acts as a call to action to encourage the site user to submit their details to arrange a callback.  The contact button has a hover effect applied so the buttons background changes when it is hovered over to draw attention to itself. The same effect is used on all buttons across the site.

![Services Images and Overlay Text](assets/images/SERVICE-SECTION.webp)
![Ifram Location Image with Overlay Text And Social Links](assets/images/iframe.webp)   


* Home Page Features Continued...
    - The home page consists of the following. One landing page with an image and welcome message located in the head, beneath that is an information section with a small brief, then another section containing three images and information about services. Then the first information box provides the site user with an introduction section about RMBT IT & Office Support Solutions Agency training, experience, and work ethos. There is also links at the bottom of the page that encourage the user to visit us on our social networks.  
    - The second information box provides brief contact information.
    - The information boxes are styled with a darker colour so that text is allowed to stand out.
    - As a decorative feature for this section. These are displayed next to each other on larger screens, but stacked on top of each other when on smaller screens, like mobile phones.
     - The iframe map feature is to show the companys location I felt adding this was important. 


* Contact Form
    - Input fields to submit name, company name, phone, and email address.
    - Text area to add information for a message to RBMT.

    - Each field has a ```required``` attribute applied to ensure users input all fields before submitting.The contact form is responsive on desktop devices and on smaller devices the contact content is stacked.

### Accessibility Testing

The full site has been passed through wave.webaim.org to check for accessibility the only error found was for a span that is necessary for my nav to work so error could not be resolved and the full report can be found  [here.](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://aol83.github.io/Remember-Me-By-Trade/)


### Bugs
---

* One of the issues I had from the beginning of this project was getting my nav to be responsive, and to change into a working hamburger drop down menu when on small devices, and a positioning inconsistency I found but after talking to fellow students and mentors adding a position of fixed and text align of center got it resolved.  

* The responsive contact form was the biggest issue I had on this project, because when I had originally put my contact form together, it was styled desktop first instead of mobile first, so i struggled to get my media queries to work, in the end I had to strip back, and start again with mobile first, and work up from there. Doing this resolved many styling issues I had encountered.


## Deployment 
----
 This site was deployed to GitHub pages.  The steps taken to deploy the site are as follows:

 * In the GitHub respository, select the settings menu
 * Choose the pages tab on the left hand side menu

## Credits
----

* I used similarly structured code for my home page, nav bar and footer as taught in the 'Love Running Walkthrough Project' on the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Development course and then made my changes from there as I wanted to add a bit of my own artistic flare to it using the sources of infomation I had been kindly give. I did change some of the styling, but ultimately I was aiming for a simliar layout for my main page and navigation link response and the footer. As this was my first project this code helped me to get off to a good start.

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has been an invaluable resource and I have read many articles relating to positioning, flexbox, and styling my contact form.

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Again a valuable resource for consolidating what I had already learned and finding out more about HTML and CSS properties.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) - I used this website to select a color pallete, I started with a natural dark purple similar to that and used that to generate a pallette of complementing colors.  From a selection of pastel palettes generated, I chose the 'Classy Palette'.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Good resource for finding answers to problems I was having that other coders had similar experiences of.

* [Google](http://google.com) - Grate source of infomation?!

* [Online Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp) - used to convert images from jpeg to webp for better performance.

* [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) used to compress images for better performance.

* Thanks to Pexels - for providing all images.
