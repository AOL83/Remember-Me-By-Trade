## Design
----

The site's owner wanted a modern 2022 style website. They decided on a six color scheme incorporating a pastel tone colour pallete from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/), we checked the colour pallete using [EigthShapes Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dn) So i decided to go with a simple design as thy chose an eight colour palette scheme of a off-whit, a shade of gray (used only on styling the navbar and footer) and these were used in contrast with an light blue for the hover state. A dark blue colour and off-white combination fot the buttons statics state gives the buttons highest rating in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) for text/background.

* Home Page Features
    -The hero-image on landing page is quite eye catching with the contrast between the bright colours natural tones it become very striking. but leaves out enough information to entice the site user to make an enquiry.
    - There is also a contact button within the navbar which links directly to the contact form page.  This acts as a call to action to encourage the site user to submit their details to arrange a callback.  The contact button has a hover effect applied so the button background changechanges when it is hovered over to draw attention to itself. The same effect is used on all buttons across the site.
