## Design
----

The site's owner wanted a modern 2022 style website. They decided on an eight color scheme incorporating a pastel tone colour pallete from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/), we checked the colour pallete using [EigthShapes Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) So i decided to go with a simple design as thy chose an eight colour palette scheme of a off-whit, a shade of gray (used only on styling the navbar and footer) and these were used in contrast with an light blue for the hover state. A dark blue colour and off-white combination fot the buttons statics state gives the buttons highest rating in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) for text/background.

![Logo](assets/images/logo.png)


* Navigation Menu 
    - This features on all pages of the website.  The position and style is consistent across all pages to allow the user to intuitively navigate each section of the mainlanding page as well as intuitively navigate to the other pages of the website.  The navigation menu also has an active class applied so the user can easily see which page they are currently on as the associated link will be marked with a neat bottom border.

* Footer 
    - Social Media Links to Facebook and Instagram and twitter to allow the user to stay connected to the company and see regular posts.
    - Telephone number and email address in footer on every page.  This means that the user does not have to navigate to a different page to have access to this information if they decide they want to email or telephone. 

![Footer](assets/images/footer.png)   
  

* Home Page Features
    -The hero-image on landing page is quite eye catching with the contrast between the bright colours natural tones become  very striking. but leaves out enough information to entice the site user to make an enquiry.
    - There is also a contact button within the navbar which links directly to the contact form page.  This acts as a call to action to encourage the site user to submit their details to arrange a callback.  The contact button has a hover effect applied so the button background changechanges when it is hovered over to draw attention to itself. The same effect is used on all buttons across the site.

![Hero Image and Overlay Text](assets/images/hero-image.png)

<br/>

* Custom 404 Page
    - I have created a custom 404 error page which will be displayed if any of the links break during future development of the site.  This page is consistent with the design of the main site and contains the same logo, navigation and footer.  There is also a link to the home page within the error message so site users are able to easily navigate back to the home page. 

![Error Page Screenshot](assets/images/error-screenshot.png)

### Features Left to Implement

* Create an events page which will show upcoming wedding fayres where potential clients can meet Pip Southgate face-to-face to ask questions.
* Create a customer reviews page. 
* Add a drop down menu to the 'home' link in the navigation menu to link to events page and customer reviews page.
* Create the back-end of the form once I have acquired the necessary skills to ensure it is fully functioning and the site owner is alerted when a potential client would like a callback.

### Bugs
---

* One of the issues I had from the beginning of this project was getting the position of the overlay text in the right place.  For a while I couldn't understand why the overlay text would stay in the same position on the screen and not adjust itself responsively, relative to the hero-image.  After many hours of fiddling around with the CSS, I realised that I had not added the ```relative ``` property to the ```#hero-image``` ID and so the overlay text was positioning itself absolute in relation to the ```#hero-image-container``` and not the ```#hero-image``` itself.  

* The image gallery has been one of my biggest problems in this project.  I started off by using a column grid to create a masonry gallery - similar to that used in the Love Running Project on the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Development Course.  This worked fine and looked great, until I added a hover effect to the images to allow them to scale up once hovered over.  Overall the effect was quite nice, however I immediately noticed that three of the top images would cut off after scaling up - which didn't look good.  After a discussion with a fellow student, I changed the gallery to flex box which fixed this issue, but brought a much larger issue when it came to making the gallery responsive.  On smaller screen sizes, the images would break out of the container and off the screen, or would break off the screen when scaling up with the hover effect.  I rectified this by adding (what felt like a million) media queries to alter the height of the container and the width of the images, depending on the screen sizes they were viewed on.  I used the dev tools to check for numerous devices and am now happy with the results.  An issue I do see with the way this gallery has been created is that it will be difficult to add new images to the gallery in the future as all of the media queries will most likely need updating at the same time.  With the benefit of hindsight, I can see that a carousel style gallery using pure CSS could have probably worked better than what I have ended up with.  In future development of this site, I would like to create a more robust gallery that is easier to update and has a slicker finish to it.

### - Bugs to fix 

* Despite the buttons on the 'Price List' and 'Contact' pages having the exact same CSS applied to them, the styling would be applied differently when in the browser - one would have the  zoom effect applied but the other wouldn't and in the Safari browser, the buttons would have different a border radius.  I realised this was because the button on the pricelist page was set as an anchor tag and the the button on the contact page was an ```input type="submit"``` button and part of the form.  I fixed this issue by changing the button on the pricelist page to from:

 ``` <a href="contact.html class="enquire-button">Contact Me</a>``` 
 
 to 

```<form action="contact.html" method="GET" aria-label="Click to open contact page"> <input type="submit" value="Contact Me" class="enquire-button"> </form>``` 
                
reusing the class attribute attached to the submit button on the contact page so as not to repeat code.  This produced the desired effect and both buttons now look and work the same. 

Whilst this is not semantically perfect, for the purpose of this project and given the time constraints, this is a suitable workaround for the time-being.  This is a bug I would like to rectify in the future when I have further understanding of applying CSS to different elements to maintain consistency across site.

* The position on the contact page of the date and time input fields are not quite in the right place on my iPhone 11 using Safar and Chrome, although I have noted from others who have tested the website on Samsung devices that the position shows as it should.  I need to do further research into why this could be happening and find a solution, however given the time constraints of this project, this is not something I have yet managed to do.  Below are the screenshots of how the form should look (using Dev Tools in Chrome) and how it actually appears on my iPhone 11 using Safari.

## Credits
----

* I used very similar code for my home page, nav bar and footer as taught in the 'Love Running Walkthrough Project' on the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Web Development course.  I did change some styling, but ultimately I was aiming for a simliar layout for my main page and navigation links/footer and as this was my first project this code helped me to get off to a good start.

* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has been an invaluable resource and I have read many articles relating to positioning, flexbox, and styling my contact form.

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Again a valuable resource for consolidating what I had already learned and finding out more about HTML and CSS properties.

* [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) - I used this website to select a color pallete, I started with a natural dark brown similar to that of the wood in the banner image and used that to generate a pallette of complementing colors.  From a selection of palettes generated, I chose the 'Classy Palette' - although as set out at the beginning of this document, this colorscheme was scrapped during the build process for something cleaner and slicker looking.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - generally a good resource for finding answers to problems I was having that other coders had similar experiences of.

* [Google](http://google.com) - need I say more?!

* [Online Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp) - used to convert images from jpeg to webp for better performance.

* [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) used to compress images for better performance.

* Pip Southgate - for providing all images and content for the website (permissions receieved from any wedding photographers and former-clients to use images).
